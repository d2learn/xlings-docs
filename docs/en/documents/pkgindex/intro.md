# Decentralized Package Index Ecosystem

xlings supports decentralized package index repositories and corresponding resource servers, meaning <mark>every individual and organization (community/company/...) can quickly build their own software ecosystem for sharing, distributing, and reusing packages internally or publicly</mark>

**xlings** itself is an open-source package management tool with **support for multiple version coexistence and management + the design philosophy that everything can be a package**. It <mark>does not hold or control package indexes and package resources itself, but only handles the establishment and management of package indexes, and serves as an executor for [xpkg packages](https://xlings.d2learn.org/documents/xpkg/intro.html)</mark>

Some possible application scenarios:

- Management and distribution of personal software/script tools/libraries/configurations
- Software ecosystem management and distribution for open-source communities
- Software version management, development environment management, and reuse within companies
- ...

::: tip

The packages or xpkgs here could be `software, libraries, scripts, plugins, configuration combinations, environment setups...` etc., not just the traditional concept of software packages. For example: the "packages" managed by this [`xim-pkgindex-awesome`](https://github.com/d2learn/xim-pkgindex-awesome) repository are actually other package index repositories

::: warning

The decentralization here means that [xlings software](https://github.com/d2learn/xlings) or [d2learn community](https://github.com/d2learn) does not hold or control package indexes and resources

Everyone can build their own ecosystem, public or private, and whether it's decentralized (based on distributed storage) or centrally managed is determined by the specific maintainers
